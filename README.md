# A side project for learning JUCE

My first goal is to make a simple synth that has following components, where I wrote each of them myself.

- 2 oscillators with 3 types of band-limited waveforms, with detune setting
- An ADSR. 
- A simple low-pass filter with freq and resonance parameters, which can use ADSR too.
- A delay effect.
- Monophony and Polyphony options.
